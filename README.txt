Learning and building multiple machine and deep learning models with a variety of datasets.

Key points:
* Deep learning > Machine learning
* Understanding pre-processing > Implementing models
* Must find relations between features



Models completed so far:
    1. Linear Regression.
    2. Multiple and Polynomial Regression.
    3. Support Vector Machine (Regression) - Using RBF kernel.
    4. Decision Tree.
    5. Random Forest.
    6. Logistic Regression.
    7. K Nearest Neighbours.
    8. Support Vector Machine (Classification) - RBF.

Approaches:
   1. Individual models:
    - Implementing and using model to predict values.
   2. Bagging.
   3. Decision Trees.
